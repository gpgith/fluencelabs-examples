Hi All,

Very straitford, I have added the char count functionality in \2-hosted-services\src\main.rc and brought the tests up to date,
followed all the build, test and deploy commands in Task 2 and upon completion without any error with the newly deployed
service's ID I have updated \3-browser-to-service\aqua\getting-started.aqua, rebuilt it and started it. Unfortunately due
to a major bug in Task 3 which I reported and was informed it is being worked on now, I could not use it to further test but will
follow closely and do these tests to.
Thankfully, the functionality in Task 2 can be tested independently anyway which is a very good thing.

Now I shall delve into the other Fluent examples and docs.
Congrats on the great support in Discord.

Thx,

Gabriel Parlea
